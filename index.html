      <h2 id="first-section">What is Stop 'N' Swop</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="tribute-info" class="limits">The Stop 'N' Swop was a feature in the original Banjo-Kazooie that is the subject of much mystery. The system was meant to provide rewards to other games in the series. It was dropped for several reasons but was restored in a later port.

  <div id="section-2">
      <h2 id="second-section">Where did it go?</h2>
    </div>
  <div id="more-info" class="limits">The bonus system had to be dropped mostly due to hardware changes on the N64 at the time. The memory was changed so that the hot swap that would be needed would be impossible. The function is still active in the game, but it cannot be used to move the items to its sequel.

 <div id="section-3">
   <h2 id="third-section">Why did it return?</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="restore-info" class="limits">When the original game was ported to the Xbox Live Arcade platform, they restored the Stop 'N' Swop for the purpose of bringing back some novel elements to its later sequels. Although they are of little importance, it is nice to see this system return.
